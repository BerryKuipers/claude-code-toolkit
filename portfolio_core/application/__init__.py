and coordinate between different domain services. It implements use cases
and application-specific business rules.

Following Clean Architecture:
- Application Services: Orchestrate domain services and entities
- Use Cases: Specific application workflows
- DTOs: Data Transfer Objects for application boundaries
- Commands/Queries: CQRS pattern implementation
