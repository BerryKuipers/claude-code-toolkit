## 🔍 Redundancy Analysis

### 1. Command vs Agent Overlap

| Name | Command | Agent | Verdict |
|------|---------|-------|---------|
| **architect** | ✅ 9.2K (TribeVibe-specific) | ✅ Yes | ⚠️ **CONSIDER**: Deprecate command, keep agent |
| **audit** | ✅ 6.8K | ✅ Yes | ⚠️ **CONSIDER**: Deprecate command, keep agent |
| **refactor** | ✅ 11K | ✅ Yes | ⚠️ **CONSIDER**: Deprecate command, keep agent |
| **design-review** | ✅ 16K | ✅ (design.md) | ⚠️ **CONSIDER**: Deprecate command, keep agent |
| **orchestrator** | ✅ 8.1K | ✅ Yes | ❌ **KEEP BOTH** - Command is user entry point |
| **conductor** | ✅ 5.3K | ✅ Yes | ❌ **KEEP BOTH** - Command is user entry point |

**Recommendation**: In 2025 agent-first approach:
- **Agents** = Workers (do the actual work)
- **Commands** = User interfaces (delegate to agents)
- Commands like `/architect` should be **thin wrappers** that delegate to architect agent
- Heavy logic should be in agents, not commands

### 2. Orchestrator vs Conductor

**NOT REDUNDANT** - Different roles:

| Aspect | Orchestrator | Conductor |
|--------|--------------|-----------|
| **Purpose** | Simple task routing | Full workflow orchestration |
| **Scope** | Single tasks | 6-phase feature lifecycle |
| **Delegation** | Routes to agents | Manages multi-agent workflows |
| **Example** | "Review architecture" → architect | "Implement issue #123" → 6 phases |
| **Complexity** | Low | High |

✅ **KEEP BOTH** - Complementary, not redundant

### 3. New Agents Not Yet Integrated

**Missing from orchestrator routing:**
- ❌ code-reviewer agent (not in routing table)
- ❌ dependency-manager agent (not in routing table)

**Action Required:**
```markdown
Update orchestrator.md routing table:

**Code Review**: review, PR, pull request, code quality
→ Route to: code-reviewer agent or /review-pr command

**Dependency Management**: dependencies, npm audit, package updates, vulnerabilities
→ Route to: dependency-manager agent or /update-deps command
```

## 🎯 2025 Best Practices: Hooks vs Agent Workflows

### Research Findings

**Traditional Approach (Pre-2025):**
```
Git Hooks (pre-commit, pre-push)
├─ Run linters locally
├─ Run tests locally
├─ Block commits if fail
└─ Issues: Slow, bypassable (--no-verify), inconsistent environments
```

**Modern Approach (2025):**
```
Agent-Based Workflows + CI/CD
├─ Lightweight local validation (agent-assisted)
├─ Heavy validation in CI (GitHub Actions, etc.)
├─ Agent-generated quality reports
└─ Benefits: Fast feedback, consistent, not bypassable
```

### Hook Usage in 2025

**✅ KEEP Hooks For:**
1. **Format-only changes** (auto-fixable):
   - Prettier formatting
   - Import sorting
   - Trailing whitespace removal

2. **Fast checks** (<5 seconds):
   - Commit message format validation
   - Prevent commits to protected branches
   - Check for secrets/API keys

**❌ AVOID Hooks For:**
1. **Slow operations** (>30 seconds):
   - Full test suites → Move to CI
   - Type checking → Move to CI/agent
   - Linting all files → Move to CI

2. **Complex validation**:
   - Architecture review → code-reviewer agent
   - Security scanning → security-pentest agent
   - Dependency audits → dependency-manager agent

### Recommendation for This Toolkit

**Current State:**
- ✅ `install-git-hooks.sh` exists
- ❓ But no actual hooks defined in toolkit

**2025 Recommendation:**

```bash
# Minimal, fast pre-commit hook
.git/hooks/pre-commit:
  1. Check for secrets (2-3 seconds)
  2. Validate commit message format (1 second)
  3. Run prettier on staged files (3-5 seconds)
  Total: <10 seconds

# Heavy validation → Use agents instead
Instead of pre-commit hooks:
  - /review-pr → code-reviewer agent
  - /update-deps → dependency-manager agent
  - /audit → audit agent
  - CI/CD → GitHub Actions with agent integration
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Fast local experience
- ✅ Heavy validation in CI (can't bypass)
- ✅ Agents provide better feedback than hook errors
- ✅ Cross-platform compatible
- ✅ Consistent across all environments

## 📋 Modernization Action Plan

### Priority 1: Critical Updates

1. **Update orchestrator agent** to include new agents:
   ```markdown
   Add to routing table:
   - code-reviewer (PR reviews, code quality)
   - dependency-manager (dependency updates, security)
   ```

2. **Deprecate redundant commands** (convert to thin wrappers):
   ```bash
   # Instead of duplicate logic in commands:
   .claude/commands/architect.md → "Delegate to architect agent"
   .claude/commands/audit.md → "Delegate to audit agent"
   .claude/commands/refactor.md → "Delegate to refactor agent"
   ```

3. **Update conductor agent** to use new specialists:
   ```markdown
   Phase 3: Quality Assurance
   - Use code-reviewer agent for quality validation
   - Use dependency-manager for vulnerability checks
   ```

### Priority 2: Hook Strategy

1. **Create minimal pre-commit hook**:
   ```bash
   scripts/hooks/pre-commit:
     - Check for secrets (gitleaks or similar)
     - Validate commit message format
     - Run prettier on staged files
     - Total time: <10 seconds
   ```

2. **Document hook philosophy**:
   ```markdown
   docs/HOOK_STRATEGY_2025.md:
     - What goes in hooks (fast, auto-fixable)
     - What goes in agents (complex validation)
     - What goes in CI (heavy testing)
   ```

3. **Update install-git-hooks.sh**:
   ```bash
   # Copy minimal hooks from toolkit
   # Document what they do and why
   # Explain what NOT to put in hooks
   ```

### Priority 3: Command Cleanup

1. **Convert agent-duplicate commands to wrappers**:
   ```bash
   # Current: architect.md has full logic
   # Modern: architect.md delegates to architect agent

   /architect → Parse args → Delegate to architect agent → Return results
   ```

2. **Consolidate test commands** (10 test-*.md files):
   ```bash
   # Consider: Single /test command with subcommands
   /test --all
   /test --user-flow
   /test --agent-system
   ```

3. **Clean up meta commands** (12 _*.md files):
   ```bash
   # Move to docs/ if they're just documentation
   # Keep in commands/ only if actually invokable
   ```

### Priority 4: Documentation

1. **Create AGENT_FIRST_WORKFLOW.md**:
   ```markdown
   - When to use agents vs commands
   - How agents work together
   - Orchestrator routing patterns
   - Conductor workflow phases
   ```

2. **Update README.md**:
   ```markdown
   Highlight agent-first approach:
   - 17 specialized agents
   - Orchestrator for routing
   - Conductor for workflows
   - Commands as thin wrappers
   ```

3. **Create migration guide**:
   ```markdown
   MIGRATING_FROM_HOOKS_TO_AGENTS.md:
   - Why move validation from hooks to agents
   - How to integrate agents with CI/CD
   - Performance comparison
   ```

## 🎯 Specific Recommendations

### Hooks vs Agents Decision Matrix

| Validation Type | Hook | Agent | CI/CD | Why |
|-----------------|------|-------|-------|-----|
| **Prettier formatting** | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ | Auto-fixable, fast (<5s) |
| **Commit message format** | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | Fast check, local only |
| **Secret detection** | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ | Fast, critical, local+CI |
| **TypeScript check** | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | Slow (>10s), better in CI |
| **Full test suite** | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | Very slow, must run in CI |
| **Code review** | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | Complex, needs AI analysis |
| **Architecture validation** | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | Complex, needs expert analysis |
| **Security scanning** | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | Slow, comprehensive |
| **Dependency audit** | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | Slow, needs investigation |

### Agent Integration Examples

**Example 1: PR Workflow (2025)**
```bash
# Old way (slow, blocks commit):
git commit
  └─ pre-commit hook runs 5 minutes of tests ❌

# New way (fast local, comprehensive CI):
git commit (minimal hook <10s) ✅
  └─ Push to GitHub
      └─ CI runs /review-pr (code-reviewer agent) ✅
          └─ Comprehensive analysis, doesn't block developer
```

**Example 2: Dependency Updates**
```bash
# Old way (manual, error-prone):
npm audit
npm update
npm test
git commit

# New way (agent-assisted):
/update-deps --scope=security --auto-test
  └─ dependency-manager agent:
      1. Audits vulnerabilities
      2. Plans safe updates
      3. Applies incrementally
      4. Tests automatically
      5. Rolls back on failure
      6. Creates PR with report
```

## 📊 Impact Assessment

### Token Optimization

**Before (command-heavy):**
```
45 commands × avg 10K = 450K potential context
Many with duplicate logic (architect, audit, refactor)
```

**After (agent-first):**
```
17 agents (specialized workers)
Commands become thin wrappers (2-3K each)
Skills reduce duplication further
Estimated 30% token savings
```

### Developer Experience

**Before:**
- Slow pre-commit hooks (if enabled)
- Duplicate commands and agents
- Unclear when to use what
- Inconsistent validation

**After:**
- Fast local feedback (<10s hooks)
- Clear agent specialization
- Orchestrator routes intelligently
- Consistent agent-based validation
- CI/CD integrated with agents

### Maintenance

**Before:**
- Update logic in both command and agent
- Hook scripts scattered
- Inconsistent approaches

**After:**
- Update logic once (in agent)
- Commands delegate to agents
- Clear hook strategy
- Agent-first mental model
