# 🚀 Crypto Insight AI Enhancement Plan

Based on Research 03's analysis, here's a structured plan for improving the AI capabilities and forecasting features.

## 🎯 Current Status
- ✅ Basic chat interface with function calling
- ✅ Portfolio analysis with FIFO accounting
- ✅ Cost tracking (now fixed)
- ✅ Multiple AI model support (OpenAI + Anthropic)

## 📋 Priority Issues to Create

### 🔧 **IMMEDIATE FIXES** (Current Branch)
1. **Fix API Cost Tracking** ✅ COMPLETED
   - Cost tracker initialization in dashboard
   - Navigation status display
   - Proper method calls

### 🤖 **AI MODEL OPTIMIZATION** (High Priority)
2. **Optimize Model Selection Strategy**
   - Implement Research 03's recommendations
   - GPT-4o as default for function calling
   - Claude Sonnet for large context (full trade history)
   - Cost-based model switching

3. **Improve Function Calling Reliability**
   - Better error handling for tool calls
   - Retry logic for failed function calls
   - Validation of function outputs

### 📊 **DATA & RETRIEVAL** (High Priority)
4. **Implement RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**
   - Embed trade history with text-embedding-3-small
   - Store in Supabase vector database
   - Query-time retrieval for large portfolios

5. **Enhanced Data Layer**
   - PostgreSQL migration for better querying
   - Nightly cron for trade synchronization
   - Better data persistence

### 🔮 **FORECASTING CAPABILITIES** (Medium Priority)
6. **Add Time-Series Forecasting**
   - StatsForecast integration (ARIMA/ETS/Theta)
   - Prophet for seasonality detection
   - Uncertainty intervals and confidence bands

7. **Advanced Forecasting Models**
   - Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) integration
   - TimeGPT/N-BEATS for pre-trained models
   - Exogenous features (on-chain metrics, funding rates)

### 🎨 **USER EXPERIENCE** (Medium Priority)
8. **Improve Chat Interface**
   - Streaming responses
   - Better error messages
   - Chat history persistence
   - Export chat conversations

9. **Enhanced Visualizations**
   - Interactive price charts
   - Forecast visualization with confidence bands
   - Portfolio allocation charts
   - Performance attribution analysis

### ⚡ **PERFORMANCE & SCALING** (Low Priority)
10. **Optimize Performance**
    - Implement proper caching strategies
    - Lazy loading for large portfolios
    - Background data updates
    - Rate limiting and queue management

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation Details

### Model Selection Logic
```python
def select_optimal_model(query_type: str, context_size: int, cost_budget: float):
    if context_size > 100_000:  # Large trade history
        return "claude-sonnet-4"
    elif query_type == "function_call":
        return "gpt-4o"  # Best function calling (now default OpenAI model)
    elif cost_budget < 0.01:
        return "gpt-4o-mini"  # Budget option with GPT-4 intelligence
    else:
        return "gpt-4o"  # Default OpenAI choice
```

### RAG Implementation
```python
# Embed trades for semantic search
embeddings = openai.embeddings.create(
    model="text-embedding-3-small",
    input=trade_descriptions
)

# Query-time retrieval
relevant_trades = vector_search(user_query, top_k=20)
context = format_trades_for_llm(relevant_trades)
```

### Forecasting Wrapper
```python
def generate_forecast(asset: str, horizon: int = 7):
    # Use StatsForecast for quick baseline
    model = StatsForecast([ARIMA(), ETS(), Theta()])
    forecast = model.forecast(h=horizon)
    
    return {
        "mean": forecast.mean(),
        "confidence_80": forecast.quantile([0.1, 0.9]),
        "confidence_95": forecast.quantile([0.025, 0.975])
    }
```
