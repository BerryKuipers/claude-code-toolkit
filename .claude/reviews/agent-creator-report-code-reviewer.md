## Architectural Compliance Validation

### ‚úÖ Hub-and-Spoke Pattern
**Compliance**: PASS

- ‚ùå Does NOT call other commands directly
- ‚úÖ Uses natural language delegation for architect specialist
- ‚úÖ Coordination through orchestrator pattern
- ‚úÖ Clear separation: Code review is analysis, implementation is separate

**Example Natural Language Delegation**:
```markdown
"I need the architect specialist to validate architecture compliance
for the changes in PR #${PR_NUMBER}.

Focus on VSA patterns, SOLID principles, and layer boundaries."
```

### ‚úÖ Separation of Concerns
**Compliance**: PASS

- ‚úÖ **Analysis ONLY** - No code modifications
- ‚úÖ Clear scope boundaries documented
- ‚úÖ Delegates to specialists when needed:
  - Architect specialist ‚Üí architecture validation
  - Security pentest agent ‚Üí deep security testing
  - Implementation/refactor agents ‚Üí code fixes
- ‚úÖ Uses quality skills for automated validation

### ‚úÖ SOLID Principles
**Compliance**: PASS

- **Single Responsibility**: Code review only - doesn't implement fixes
- **Open/Closed**: Extensible review categories without modification
- **Dependency Inversion**: Depends on quality skill abstractions

### ‚úÖ DRY Principles
**Compliance**: PASS

- ‚úÖ No duplication with existing agents:
  - `audit.md` ‚Üí Comprehensive system audit (broader scope)
  - `security-pentest.md` ‚Üí Deep security testing (specialized)
  - `code-reviewer.md` ‚Üí PR-focused code review (unique niche)
- ‚úÖ Reuses existing quality skills
- ‚úÖ Leverages existing tooling (npm audit, gh CLI)

### ‚úÖ Markdown-First
**Compliance**: PASS

- ‚úÖ Proper YAML frontmatter
- ‚úÖ Natural language workflow descriptions
- ‚úÖ No shell scripts (uses bash blocks within phases)
- ‚úÖ Structured with clear phases

### ‚úÖ Complexity Limits
**Compliance**: PASS

- ‚úÖ 8 workflow phases (within ‚â§10 limit)
- ‚úÖ Each phase has clear goal and success criteria
- ‚úÖ Proper delegation for complex sub-tasks

### ‚úÖ Natural Language Delegation
**Compliance**: PASS

**Example patterns used**:
```markdown
‚úÖ "I need the architect specialist to validate..."
‚úÖ "Consult the security specialist for..."
‚úÖ "Use quality skills for automated validation..."

‚ùå NOT: Task({ subagent_type: "architect", ... })
‚ùå NOT: SlashCommand("/architect", ...)
```

## Quality Features

### Constructive Review Philosophy

**Educational Approach**:
- Explains WHY something is an issue
- Provides code examples of better implementations
- Includes links to best practice documentation
- Acknowledges good practices found

**Example Feedback**:
```markdown
### [HIGH-001] Missing Error Handling

**Issue**:
\`\`\`typescript
async function processPayment(amount: number) {
  const result = await stripe.charges.create({ amount });
  return result;
}
\`\`\`

**Problem**: No try-catch. Uncaught errors crash service.

**Impact**: Poor user experience, service instability.

**Recommended Fix**:
\`\`\`typescript
async function processPayment(amount: number) {
  try {
    const result = await stripe.charges.create({ amount });
    return { success: true, data: result };
  } catch (error) {
    logger.error('Payment failed', { error, amount });
    return { success: false, error: 'Payment failed' };
  }
}
\`\`\`

**Why**: Graceful error handling improves reliability and debuggability.
**Reference**: [Node.js Error Handling Best Practices](...)
```

### Pattern-Based Detection

**Automated checks for common issues**:
- SQL injection patterns (`execute|query|raw.*${`)
- XSS risks (`dangerouslySetInnerHTML|innerHTML`)
- Hardcoded secrets (`password\s*=|api[_-]?key`)
- Missing authentication (`router.(get|post)` without auth)
- N+1 query problems (loops with database queries)
- React performance (`export function Component` without memo)
- Unhandled promises (`.then(` without `.catch()`)
- TypeScript `any` types
- Console.log in production code
- TODO without issue references

### Comprehensive Coverage

**Review Dimensions**:
1. Code Quality (readability, complexity, DRY)
2. Security (OWASP patterns, auth, secrets)
3. Performance (algorithms, caching, N+1)
4. Error Handling (try-catch, logging, graceful degradation)
5. Testing (coverage, edge cases, test quality)
6. Documentation (JSDoc, README, API docs)
7. Architecture (layer boundaries, SOLID, patterns)

## Integration Guide

### Step 1: Create `/review-pr` Command

Create `.claude/commands/review-pr.md`:

```markdown
# Review Pull Request

**Arguments:** [PR_NUMBER] [--focus] [--post-to-pr]

Delegates to code-reviewer agent for comprehensive PR review.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Invoke Code Reviewer Agent

Describe the need in natural language:

"I need a comprehensive code review for PR #$1.

Focus areas: ${FOCUS:-all}
Post results to PR: ${POST_TO_PR:-false}
Create tracking issues: ${CREATE_ISSUES:-false}

The code reviewer should analyze:
- Code quality and best practices
- Security vulnerabilities
- Performance concerns
- Test coverage and quality
- Documentation completeness

Generate a detailed review report with actionable recommendations."
```

### Step 2: Update OrchestratorAgent

Add to orchestrator's task analysis:

```markdown
**Code Review Tasks**: Keywords: `review`, `pr`, `code quality`, `pull request`
- **Delegation**: Delegate to code-reviewer agent
- **Tools**: Read, Grep, Glob, Bash, Write
- **When to use**: PR review requests, code quality assessments
```

### Step 3: Optional CI/CD Integration

Add to GitHub Actions:

```yaml
- name: Automated Code Review
  run: |
    # Set environment
    export PR_NUMBER=${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}
    export OUTPUT_FORMAT=json

    # Run review (would need claude-code in CI)
    # This is a placeholder - actual integration TBD
    echo "Code review for PR #${PR_NUMBER}"
```
