- Frequency: **6 times per full-cycle workflow**
- Most frequently used skill

**Key Features**:
- Create `.claude/state/conductor.json` with workflow metadata
- Track current phase and completed phases
- Save issue context, branch name, PR number
- Include phase-specific outputs (architecture plan, audit score, etc.)

**Integration**: Critical for workflow resumption across sessions

---

### 3. load-resumption-state
**Category**: State Management
**Path**: `.claude/skills/state-management/load-resumption-state/SKILL.md`
**Size**: 381 lines

**Purpose**: Load saved workflow state and analyze git to determine resumption point

**Used In**:
- Start of every conductor workflow
- Frequency: Every workflow start

**Key Features**:
- Load `.claude/state/conductor.json` if exists
- Analyze current git state (branch, commits, PR)
- Determine correct resumption phase based on state + git
- Decision matrix: branch exists + commits → Phase 3, branch + PR → Phase 5, etc.
- Validate quality gates if resuming late phases
- Return resumption recommendation

**Integration**: Smart resumption system - prevents duplicate work

---

### 4. create-feature-branch
**Category**: Git Workflow
**Path**: `.claude/skills/git-workflows/create-feature-branch/SKILL.md`
**Size**: 312 lines

**Purpose**: Create properly named feature branch with remote tracking

**Used In**:
- Conductor Phase 2, Step 1 (Branch Setup)
- Every feature workflow
- Frequency: Once per feature

**Key Features**:
- Standard naming: `feature/issue-<NUMBER>-<description>`
- Sync with development branch first
- Check if branch already exists (resumption support)
- Create and push to remote with tracking (`git push -u`)
- Validate branch created successfully
- Extract issue number from branch name

**Integration**: Sets up feature branch for implementation

---

### 5. record-quality-baseline
**Category**: Quality Validation
**Path**: `.claude/skills/quality/record-quality-baseline/SKILL.md`
**Size**: 338 lines

**Purpose**: Record quality metrics before refactoring for comparison

**Used In**:
- Refactor agent Step 1 (Pre-Refactor Validation)
- Before major code changes
- Frequency: Before every refactoring

**Key Features**:
- Run tests with coverage
- Extract coverage metrics (overall, statements, branches, functions)
- Run code quality audit (if available)
- Check TypeScript errors
- Save baseline to `.claude/baseline/quality-baseline.json`
- Block refactoring if tests failing
- Enable before/after comparison

**Integration**: Refactor agent uses this to ensure quality improvements

---

### 6. commit-with-validation
**Category**: Git Workflow
**Path**: `.claude/skills/git-workflows/commit-with-validation/SKILL.md`
**Size**: 402 lines

**Purpose**: Create single atomic commit with proper format and validation

**Used In**:
- Conductor Phase 4, Step 2 (PR Creation)
- Every feature completion
- Frequency: Once per feature

**Key Features**:
- Standardized commit message format (feat/fix/refactor)
- Proper issue linking: `Fixes #123`
- Co-authoring attribution
- Pre-commit hooks run automatically (NEVER --no-verify)
- Handle hook auto-fixes (amend if safe, or new commit)
- Validate authorship before amending
- Stage all changes

**Integration**: Only commit point in conductor workflow - happens after all quality gates pass

---

## Validation Results

All 6 skills tested and validated:
- ✅ Valid YAML frontmatter
- ✅ Name field present (all under 64 chars)
- ✅ Description field present (all under 1024 chars)
- ✅ All under 500 lines (no need for REFERENCE.md)
- ✅ No structural errors

## Usage Impact

### Conductor Workflow

**Before** (without skills):
- Inline GitHub CLI operations (~50 lines)
- Inline state management (~80 lines)
- Inline git operations (~40 lines)
- Total: ~170 lines of repetitive code

**After** (with skills):
- Reference 6 skills by name
- Skills handle all implementation details
- Conductor focuses on orchestration
- Estimated reduction: ~140 lines (20% of Phase 1-4)

### Refactor Workflow

**Before**: Inline quality baseline logic
**After**: `record-quality-baseline` skill - standardized validation

### Frequency Analysis

| Skill | Uses Per Workflow | Total Uses (10 features) |
|-------|-------------------|--------------------------|
| save-workflow-state | 6 | 60 |
| load-resumption-state | 1 | 10 |
| fetch-github-issue-analysis | 1 | 10 |
| create-feature-branch | 1 | 10 |
| commit-with-validation | 1 | 10 |
| record-quality-baseline | Variable | ~5-10 |

**Most impactful**: `save-workflow-state` (6x per workflow!)

```markdown
**Step 1: Issue Selection**

Use `fetch-github-issue-analysis` skill:
- Input: issue_number
- Output: issue data + AI analysis (if available)
```

### Conductor Phase 2
```markdown
**Step 1: Create Feature Branch**

Use `create-feature-branch` skill:
- Input: issue_number, issue_title

```

### Conductor (Throughout)
```markdown
**After Each Phase**:

Use `save-workflow-state` skill:
- Input: issue_number, current_phase, context
- Output: state file created at `.claude/state/conductor.json`
```

### Refactor Agent
