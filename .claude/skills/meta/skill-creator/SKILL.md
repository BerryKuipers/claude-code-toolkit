# Skill Creator

## Purpose

Interactive wizard that helps create new Claude Skills with proper structure, YAML frontmatter, progressive disclosure, and validation. Asks clarifying questions to generate well-formatted skills automatically.

## When to Use

- Creating new Claude Skills from workflow patterns
- Converting repetitive agent code into reusable skills
- Standardizing skill format across team
- Teaching skill creation best practices
- Bootstrapping skill structure quickly

## Instructions

### Step 1: Gather Requirements

Ask the user about the workflow they want to automate:

```
üéØ Skill Creator - Interactive Wizard

I'll help you create a new Claude Skill. Let me ask a few questions:

1. What workflow or task do you want to automate?
   (Describe in 1-2 sentences)

2. When should this skill be triggered?
   Example: "When tests fail", "Before creating PR", "During implementation"

3. What tools/commands does this workflow use?
   Example: "git, gh CLI, npm test", "curl, jq, bash"

4. What inputs does this workflow need?
   Example: "issue number, branch name", "file path, test pattern"

5. What should the output be?
   Example: "JSON with results", "Success/failure message", "Generated files"
```

### Step 2: Validate Skill Name

```bash
# Skill naming rules:
# - Lowercase with hyphens (kebab-case)
# - Descriptive and concise
# - No more than 64 characters
# - Examples: fetch-issue-analysis, validate-typescript, root-cause-tracing

SKILL_NAME="<user-provided-name>"

# Validate length
if [ ${#SKILL_NAME} -gt 64 ]; then
  echo "‚ùå Skill name too long (max 64 chars)"
  echo "Suggested: $(echo "$SKILL_NAME" | cut -c1-64)"
fi

# Validate format
if ! echo "$SKILL_NAME" | grep -Eq '^[a-z][a-z0-9-]*$'; then
  echo "‚ùå Invalid format. Use lowercase letters, numbers, hyphens only"
  echo "Example: fetch-github-issue"
fi
```

### Step 3: Create Description (Max 1024 chars)

```
Description Guidelines:
- Start with action verb (Fetch, Validate, Create, Run, etc.)
- Explain WHAT it does, not HOW
- Include primary use case
- Keep under 1024 characters (will be loaded at startup)
- Mention integration points if relevant

Example:
"Fetch GitHub issue details with AI analysis comment from github-actions bot, extracting structured data for architecture planning in workflow automation"
```

### Step 4: Determine Skill Category

```
Select category (creates directory structure):

1. state-management/     - Workflow state, checkpoints, recovery
2. github-integration/   - GitHub API, issues, PRs, reviews
3. git-workflows/        - Git operations, branching, commits
4. quality/              - Testing, validation, gates
5. testing/              - Test execution, coverage
6. gemini-api/           - Gemini API patterns, rate limiting
7. debugging/            - Error diagnosis, root cause tracing
8. meta/                 - Skills about skills, creation, templates
9. custom/               - Project-specific patterns

Enter number or custom category name:
```

### Step 5: Estimate Complexity

```
Complexity estimation (determines progressive disclosure):

Simple (< 200 lines):
  - Single script/command
  - Few parameters
  - No conditionals
  ‚Üí Single SKILL.md file

Medium (200-500 lines):
  - Multiple steps
  - Decision logic
  - Several examples
  ‚Üí SKILL.md only

Complex (> 500 lines):
  - Extensive workflows
  - Many examples
  - Detailed reference
  ‚Üí SKILL.md + REFERENCE.md (progressive disclosure)
  ‚Üí Consider validation scripts in scripts/

Estimated complexity for your skill: [Simple/Medium/Complex]
```

### Step 6: Generate Directory Structure

```bash
CATEGORY="<selected-category>"
SKILL_NAME="<validated-name>"
COMPLEXITY="<simple|medium|complex>"

# Create base structure
mkdir -p ".claude/skills/$CATEGORY/$SKILL_NAME"

# Simple/Medium: SKILL.md only
if [ "$COMPLEXITY" != "complex" ]; then
  touch ".claude/skills/$CATEGORY/$SKILL_NAME/SKILL.md"
fi

# Complex: Add progressive disclosure
if [ "$COMPLEXITY" = "complex" ]; then
  touch ".claude/skills/$CATEGORY/$SKILL_NAME/SKILL.md"
  touch ".claude/skills/$CATEGORY/$SKILL_NAME/REFERENCE.md"
  mkdir -p ".claude/skills/$CATEGORY/$SKILL_NAME/scripts"
fi

echo "‚úÖ Created structure at .claude/skills/$CATEGORY/$SKILL_NAME/"
```

### Step 7: Generate SKILL.md Template

```markdown
---
name: ${SKILL_NAME}
description: ${DESCRIPTION}
---

# ${TITLE}

## Purpose

[1-2 paragraph explanation of what this skill does and why it exists]

## When to Use

- [Use case 1]
- [Use case 2]
- [Integration point - e.g., "Conductor Phase 2"]

## Instructions

### Step 1: [First Action]

\`\`\`bash
# Example commands or code
PARAM1=\${1:-"default"}

# Validate inputs
if [ -z "$PARAM1" ]; then
  echo "‚ùå Error: Parameter required"
  exit 1
fi
\`\`\`

### Step 2: [Second Action]

\`\`\`bash
# Implementation
\`\`\`

### Step 3: [Output/Return]

Output format:

\`\`\`json
{
  "status": "success",
  "result": "..."
}
\`\`\`

## Integration with [Agent/Workflow]

Used in [agent name] [phase]:

\`\`\`markdown
**Step X: [Task Name]**

Use \`${SKILL_NAME}\` skill:
- Input: [parameters]
- Output: [result]
\`\`\`

## Error Handling

### [Error Case 1]

\`\`\`json
{
  "status": "error",
  "error": "Description",
  "code": "ERROR_CODE"
}
\`\`\`

## Related Skills

- \`related-skill-1\` - Brief description
- \`related-skill-2\` - Brief description

## Examples

### Example 1: [Common Case]

\`\`\`bash
# Input
${SKILL_NAME} param1 param2

# Output
{
  "status": "success"
}
\`\`\`

## Best Practices

1. **Practice 1** - Explanation
2. **Practice 2** - Explanation

## Notes

- Important consideration 1
- Important consideration 2
```

### Step 8: Generate REFERENCE.md (if complex)

Only for complex skills (> 500 lines estimated):

```markdown
# ${SKILL_NAME} - Reference Documentation

## Detailed API Reference

[Comprehensive technical details that don't fit in SKILL.md]

## Advanced Use Cases

### Use Case 1: [Advanced Scenario]

[Detailed explanation with code]

### Use Case 2: [Edge Case]

[Detailed explanation with code]

## Decision Matrices

[Complex decision trees, lookup tables, extensive examples]

## Schema Reference

[JSON schemas, data structures, type definitions]

## Troubleshooting Guide

[Common errors and resolutions]
```

### Step 9: Add Validation Scripts (if complex)

For complex skills, offer to create validation scripts:

```bash
# Example: scripts/validate-input.sh

#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -e

INPUT=$1

# Validation logic
if [ -z "$INPUT" ]; then
  echo "ERROR: Input required"
  exit 1
fi

echo "VALID"
exit 0
```

Advantages:
- Scripts consume 0 context tokens (only output counted)
- Deterministic, repeatable
- Faster execution
- Version controlled

### Step 10: Update Skills Catalog

Add new skill to `.claude/skills/README.md`:

```markdown
### ${CATEGORY}

- **${SKILL_NAME}** - ${DESCRIPTION}
  - Files: SKILL.md [+ REFERENCE.md] [+ scripts/]
  - Complexity: [Simple/Medium/Complex]
  - Integration: [Where used]
```

### Step 11: Validation Checklist

```
‚úÖ Validation Checklist:

[ ] YAML frontmatter present with name + description
[ ] Name is kebab-case, ‚â§ 64 chars
[ ] Description ‚â§ 1024 chars
[ ] SKILL.md has clear structure:
    - Purpose
    - When to Use
    - Instructions (step by step)
    - Integration points
    - Error handling
    - Related skills
    - Examples
[ ] If > 500 lines: Content split to REFERENCE.md
[ ] If validation needed: Scripts in scripts/ directory
[ ] Related skills cross-referenced
[ ] Added to README.md catalog
[ ] Examples include both input and output
[ ] Error cases documented with JSON format
```

## Output Format

### Success

### With Warnings

```
‚ö†Ô∏è Skill Created with Warnings:

Location: .claude/skills/${CATEGORY}/${SKILL_NAME}/

Warnings:
  ‚ö†Ô∏è Description is ${CHAR_COUNT}/1024 chars (close to limit)
  ‚ö†Ô∏è Skill seems complex (${ESTIMATED_LINES} lines) - consider REFERENCE.md
  ‚ö†Ô∏è No validation scripts - consider adding for deterministic checks

Review and address warnings before use.
```

## Integration with Development Workflow

### Used by Developers

When creating new workflow automation:

```markdown
**Developer**: "I keep running the same git commands for feature branches"

**Claude**: "Let me use the skill-creator skill to automate that"

[Runs skill-creator, asks questions, generates create-feature-branch skill]

**Result**: Reusable skill saved to .claude/skills/git-workflows/
```

### Used by Conductor

When discovering repetitive patterns:

```markdown
**Conductor Phase 6**: Generate final report

If repetitive patterns detected during workflow:
  "I noticed you ran [command sequence] 3 times"
  "Would you like me to create a skill for this?"

  If yes: Use skill-creator to generate skill
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Start with "Why"

Always explain WHY the skill exists before HOW it works:

```markdown
## Purpose

**Why**: Developers waste 10 minutes per feature branch creating standardized branch names manually. This skill automates the process, ensuring consistent naming (feature/issue-123-description) and proper base branch setup.

**What**: Creates feature branch with validation, issue linking, and automatic tracking.
```

### 2. Progressive Disclosure

Keep frequently-accessed content in SKILL.md, move details to REFERENCE.md:

```markdown
## SKILL.md (Common workflows)

For advanced configuration, see REFERENCE.md Section 3.2

## REFERENCE.md (Details)

### Section 3.2: Advanced Configuration

[Extensive details here]
```

### 3. Validation Scripts for Determinism

If logic is deterministic, extract to scripts:

```bash
# ‚ùå Don't: Inline logic consuming tokens
```bash
if grep -q "test" file.txt; then
  if [ $(wc -l < file.txt) -gt 10 ]; then
    # complex validation logic
  fi
fi
```

# ‚úÖ Do: Script consuming 0 tokens
bash scripts/validate-file.sh file.txt
```

### 4. Cross-Reference Related Skills

Help users discover complementary skills:

```markdown
## Related Skills

- `create-feature-branch` - Creates branch (run before this skill)
- `commit-with-validation` - Commits changes (run after this skill)
- `create-pull-request` - Creates PR (final step in workflow)

**Typical workflow**: create-feature-branch ‚Üí [implementation] ‚Üí THIS SKILL ‚Üí create-pull-request
```

### 5. Include Integration Examples

Show how skills integrate with agents:

```markdown
## Integration with Conductor

Used in Phase 2 (Implementation), Step 4:

**Before implementation**:
Use `validate-architecture` to ensure design alignment

**After implementation**:
Proceed to Phase 3 (Quality Assurance)
```

## Examples

### Example 1: Simple Skill (< 200 lines)

```bash
User: "I want to check if tests exist before editing code"

Output:
.claude/skills/quality/check-tests-exist/
  SKILL.md

Content:
- 150 lines
- Single workflow
- No REFERENCE.md needed
```

### Example 2: Medium Skill (200-500 lines)

```bash
User: "I want to validate TypeScript compilation"

Output:
.claude/skills/quality/validate-typescript/
  SKILL.md

Content:
- 400 lines
- Multiple validation modes
- Examples and error handling
- No REFERENCE.md yet (under 500 line threshold)
```

### Example 3: Complex Skill (> 500 lines)

```bash
User: "I want to save complete workflow state for resumption"

Output:
.claude/skills/state-management/save-workflow-state/
  SKILL.md          # 250 lines - common workflows
  REFERENCE.md      # 200 lines - state schema, decision matrix
  scripts/
    validate-state.sh

Progressive disclosure:
- SKILL.md: How to save state (always loaded)
- REFERENCE.md: State schema details (loaded on-demand)
- scripts/: Validation logic (0 tokens, output only)
```

## Error Handling

### Invalid Skill Name

```
‚ùå Error: Invalid skill name "Fetch_Issue"

Skill names must:
- Use lowercase letters only
- Use hyphens for word separation (kebab-case)
- Be ‚â§ 64 characters
- Start with letter

Suggested: "fetch-issue"
```

### Description Too Long

```
‚ö†Ô∏è Warning: Description is 1,150 characters (limit: 1,024)

Description loaded at startup - keep concise!

Current:
