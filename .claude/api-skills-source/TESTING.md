# API Skills Integration Testing

## Uploaded Skills (Available)

| Skill Name | Skill ID | Status |
|-----------|----------|--------|
| quality-gate | `skill_016qnPYM55EUfzTjTCeL4Zng` | ✅ Uploaded (Session 1) |
| validate-typescript | `skill_01TYxAPLSwWUAJvpiBgaDcfn` | ✅ Uploaded (Session 2) |
| run-comprehensive-tests | `skill_01EfbHCDmLehZ9CNKxxRBMzZ` | ✅ Uploaded (Session 2) |
| validate-coverage-threshold | `skill_01KvzeoAq1YbafijP1RiJSJw` | ✅ Uploaded (Session 2) |

## How API Skills Work

1. **Upload**: Skills uploaded via Anthropic Skills API
2. **Registration**: Skills registered to your API key
3. **Availability**: Should be available in Claude.ai, Claude Code, and Messages API
4. **Invocation**: Claude should auto-detect and use skills when appropriate

## Testing Status

### ✅ Verified:
- Skills upload successfully to Anthropic API
- Skills have valid IDs and version numbers
- Skills execute correctly locally with proper JSON output
- Error handling works (tested with project's TypeScript errors)

### ❓ To Verify:
- **Agent invocation**: Can agents reference skills by ID?
- **Runtime integration**: Does Claude Code runtime recognize uploaded skills?
- **Automatic discovery**: Does Claude automatically use skills when prompted?

## Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Direct Skill Reference
**Test**: Ask Claude to use validate-typescript skill by ID
**Expected**: Skill executes and returns TypeScript validation results

### Scenario 2: Natural Language Trigger
**Test**: "Check the TypeScript types in this project"
**Expected**: Claude automatically invokes validate-typescript skill

### Scenario 3: Agent Delegation
**Test**: Have conductor agent try to use quality-gate skill
**Expected**: Agent successfully delegates to API skill

## Known Limitations

1. **No Update API**: Cannot re-upload skills with same name
2. **Version Mismatch**: Uploaded versions lack Gemini improvements
3. **Documentation Gap**: Unclear how skills are invoked in Claude Code

## Next Steps

1. Try invoking a skill explicitly
2. Test natural language triggers
3. Document actual invocation mechanism
4. Update conductor agent if needed

## Notes

- Skills are tied to ANTHROPIC_SKILLS_API_KEY
- Skills should work across all Claude platforms
- May need to reference skills by ID in agent prompts
