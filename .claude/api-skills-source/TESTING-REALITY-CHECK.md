# API Skills Testing Reality Check

## Critical Finding: We Haven't Actually Tested Runtime Integration! ⚠️

### What We've Verified ✅
1. ✅ Skills upload successfully to Anthropic API (via `/v1/skills` endpoint)
2. ✅ Skills get valid IDs and version numbers
3. ✅ Skills execute correctly when run locally as Python scripts
4. ✅ Skills can be updated via `/v1/skills/{id}/versions` endpoint
5. ✅ Skills produce proper structured JSON output

### What We HAVEN'T Verified ❌
1. ❌ **Can Claude Code runtime access our uploaded custom skills?**
2. ❌ **Can agents invoke these skills in actual workflows?**
3. ❌ **Does natural language trigger skill execution?**
4. ❌ **What's the actual invocation mechanism in Claude Code?**
5. ❌ **Do uploaded skills work in Claude.ai conversations?**

## Testing Limitations

### Web Environment Constraints
- Cannot use `gh` CLI (blocked in web environment)
- Cannot trigger full conductor workflows (requires GitHub integration)
- Cannot test PR creation flows
- Limited ability to test agent delegation

### Skills Upload vs Skills Access
**We uploaded skills to Anthropic API, but:**
- No evidence they're automatically available in Claude Code
- No `.claude/skills/` directory in home (checked)
- No skills configuration in `~/.claude/settings.json`
- May only work via **Messages API** with explicit skill_id parameter

## How Skills Actually Work (Based on Research)

### 1. Messages API (Confirmed)
```python
import anthropic

client = anthropic.Anthropic(api_key="your-key")

response = client.messages.create(
    model="claude-sonnet-4-5",
    max_tokens=1024,
    betas=["code-execution-2025-08-25", "skills-2025-10-02"],
    tools=[
        {"type": "code_execution_20250825"},
        {"type": "custom", "skill_id": "skill_01TYxAPLSwWUAJvpiBgaDcfn"}
    ],
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Validate TypeScript"}]
)
```

**This we know works** - it's documented in Anthropic API docs.

### 2. Claude.ai Web Interface (Likely Works)
- Upload custom skills via ZIP in settings
- OR skills uploaded via API should be available if logged in with same account
- Skills are automatically detected when relevant

**We haven't tested this** - would need to access Claude.ai with same API key account.

### 3. Claude Code (CONFIRMED via Research)

**✅ RESEARCH FINDINGS (October 2025):**

**Three SEPARATE Skill Sources (No Auto-Sync):**
1. **Local `.claude/skills/` directory** - Filesystem skills (bash-based)
   - Auto-discovered by Claude Code
   - Work in current session
   - Stored locally in project

2. **Claude.ai Web Uploads** - Account-specific skills
   - Uploaded via Claude.ai settings
   - Available when logged into that account
   - Separate from API uploads

3. **API Uploaded Skills** - Programmatic uploads
   - Uploaded via POST `/v1/skills` endpoint
   - Available via Messages API with explicit `skill_id`
   - **NOT automatically synced to `.claude/skills/` directory**
   - **NOT automatically available in Claude Code sessions**

**Key Discovery:**
- API-uploaded skills and `.claude/skills/` are **completely separate**
- No automatic sync mechanism between them
- Uploading to API doesn't make skills available in Claude Code local sessions
- Claude Code only auto-discovers skills in local `.claude/skills/` directory

**Implication for Our Work:**
- Our 8 API skills exist in Anthropic cloud (accessible via Messages API)
- But they're NOT available in this Claude Code web session
- Need to also maintain filesystem versions in `.claude/skills/` for Claude Code use
- Result: **Two parallel skill systems** for maximum coverage

## What "Describe the need" Pattern Might Be

Based on our documentation:
```markdown
"I need to validate TypeScript using validate-typescript API skill (skill_01TYxAPLSwWUAJvpiBgaDcfn)"
```

**This might be:**
1. ❓ A wishful thinking pattern (we invented it)
2. ❓ Natural language that Claude interprets
3. ❓ Needs explicit tool invocation somehow
4. ❓ Only works if skills are pre-configured

**We don't actually know if this works!**

## ✅ ACTUAL TESTING RESULTS (October 2025)

### Test 1: Agent Invocation of API Skills

**Test Setup:**
- Delegated to architect agent
- Asked to invoke validate-typescript API skill (skill_01TYxAPLSwWUAJvpiBgaDcfn)
- Tested if agents can access cloud-uploaded skills

**Results:**
```
❌ AGENTS CANNOT ACCESS API SKILLS

Agent reported:
- NO Skill tool available
- NO APISkill tool available
- NO mechanism to invoke skill_01TYxAPLSwWUAJvpiBgaDcfn
- Only has: Read, Grep, Glob, Bash, Write tools
- Attempted to fall back to manual tsc --noEmit (which we blocked)
```

**Conclusion:**
**API skills uploaded to Anthropic cloud are NOT accessible to agents in Claude Code.**

### Test 2: Available Tools Check

**What Agents Have:**
- Standard toolset only (Read, Grep, Glob, Bash, Write, Edit, Task, etc.)
- No `Skill()` tool for invoking API skills
- No access to `/v1/skills` endpoint
- No mechanism to reference skill_01TYxAPLSwWUAJvpiBgaDcfn

**What Agents DON'T Have:**
- ❌ API skill invocation capability
- ❌ Cloud skill access
- ❌ Ability to use uploaded custom skills

### Test 3: Filesystem Skills (Control Test)

**What DOES Work:**
- ✅ Filesystem skills in `.claude/skills/` ARE auto-discovered
- ✅ Claude Code uses them as instruction guides
- ✅ Agents can reference and follow their instructions
- ✅ Work immediately in current session

### Tests Requiring External Access

**Test 4: Messages API Direct Call**
- Create Python script that calls Messages API
- Include custom skill in tools array
- Verify skill executes and returns results
- **Blocker:** Need to set up API call environment

**Test 5: Claude.ai Web Test**
- Log into Claude.ai with same account as API key
- Try to use uploaded skills in conversation
- See if they're listed in settings
- **Blocker:** Need Claude.ai access with correct account

**Test 6: Agent Workflow Integration**
- Trigger conductor workflow in environment with GitHub
- Let it reach Phase 3 quality gates
- Verify it can invoke quality-gate skill
- **Blocker:** Need GitHub CLI access

## Current Status

### What We've Built ✅
- 8 production-ready API skills
- Complete documentation
- Upload and update scripts
- Agent integration patterns
- Migration prompts

### What We Don't Know ❌
- **How to actually use these skills in Claude Code** ⚠️
- Whether they work without additional configuration
- What the correct invocation syntax is
- If agents can access them

## Recommendations

### Option 1: Document Uncertainty (Honest)
Update all documentation to say:
```
⚠️ NOTE: These skills are uploaded to Anthropic API and should work
via Messages API. Integration with Claude Code web environment is
UNTESTED. May require additional configuration or account setup.
```

### Option 2: Test via Messages API
Create a test script that:
1. Uses Messages API directly
2. Includes our custom skills
3. Verifies they execute
4. Documents working invocation pattern

### Option 3: Test in Different Environment
- Try in Claude Code desktop app (if available)
- Try in Claude.ai web interface
- Try with GitHub CLI enabled environment

### Option 4: Ask Anthropic Support
- Contact support about custom skills in Claude Code
- Ask how uploaded skills become available
- Get official invocation documentation

## Impact on Documentation

### Current Documentation Claims
Our docs say:
- ✅ Skills work across Claude.ai, Claude Code, API (UNVERIFIED for Code)
- ✅ Agents should use skills with "Describe the need" pattern (UNTESTED)
- ✅ Skills are automatically detected (ASSUMPTION)

### What We Should Say
Be honest about testing status:
- ✅ Skills uploaded to Anthropic API successfully
- ✅ Skills execute correctly as standalone Python scripts
- ⚠️ Runtime integration with Claude Code web: UNTESTED
- ⚠️ Agent invocation patterns: THEORETICAL
- ✅ Messages API integration: DOCUMENTED BY ANTHROPIC

## Next Steps

1. **Update documentation** with testing status
2. **Try simple invocation test** (ask for TypeScript validation naturally)
3. **Create Messages API test script** (if environment allows)
4. **Document actual findings** (what works, what doesn't)
5. **Update agent patterns** based on what actually works

## ✅ CONCLUSION & VERIFIED STRATEGY

We built a comprehensive, well-documented API skills ecosystem AND tested how they work.

### Critical Discoveries (Research + Testing)

**Discovery 1:** API-uploaded skills and `.claude/skills/` filesystem skills are **two separate systems** with no automatic sync.

**Discovery 2:** ✅ **TESTED AND CONFIRMED** - Agents in Claude Code **CANNOT access API skills** uploaded to Anthropic cloud.

### Verified Solution: Dual-Track Skill System

1. **API Skills** (`.claude/api-skills-source/`)
   - ✅ Uploaded to Anthropic cloud
   - ✅ Available via Messages API (programmatic use) - **Documented by Anthropic**
   - ✅ Work in Claude.ai web (when logged in) - **Assumed**
   - ✅ Portable across platforms
   - ❌ **TESTED: NOT available in Claude Code agent sessions**

2. **Filesystem Skills** (`.claude/skills/`)
   - ✅ Auto-discovered by Claude Code - **Verified**
   - ✅ Work in current Claude Code sessions - **Confirmed**
   - ✅ Immediate availability - **Works now**
   - ❌ Local only (not portable)

### Strategy (Based on Testing)

**For Claude Code Users (This Environment):**
- ✅ Use filesystem skills (`.claude/skills/`)
- ✅ Already available and working
- ✅ Agents reference them automatically

**For Messages API Users:**
- ✅ Use API skills with explicit skill_id
- Include in tools array: `{"type": "custom", "skill_id": "skill_01..."}`
- Programmatic invocation only

**For TribeVibe Migration:**
- ✅ Copy filesystem skills (generic, ready to use)
- Works immediately in their Claude Code environment
- No API skill setup needed

### What We've Completed

1. ✅ Created 8 API skills (uploaded to Anthropic cloud)
2. ✅ Created/updated 8+ filesystem skills (local Claude Code)
3. ✅ Made all skills generic (work with any TS/JS project)
4. ✅ Fixed Gemini PR feedback (text fallback, error parsing)
5. ✅ Discovered and documented skill versioning
6. ✅ **TESTED agent API skill access (CONFIRMED: not available)**
7. ✅ Documented dual-track system completely
