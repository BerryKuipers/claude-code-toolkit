# Architecture Tester - Dry Run Command Validation

**Arguments:** [scenario] [--dry-run] [--verbose]

**Success Criteria:** Hub-and-spoke architecture validated, no forbidden patterns detected, proper delegation flows confirmed

**Description:** Safe testing of command architecture patterns without affecting real code or data. Validates orchestrator delegation, prevents command conflicts, and verifies proper hub-and-spoke workflows.

## Usage

```bash
# Run all architecture tests
/architecture-tester

# Run specific scenario
/architecture-tester scenario1

# Verbose output with detailed analysis
/architecture-tester --verbose

# Dry run mode (safe, no real operations)
/architecture-tester --dry-run
```

## Expected Output

The tester validates that:
1. **Orchestrator is the only central hub** for command coordination
2. **No direct command-to-command calls** exist in the system
3. **Proper delegation patterns** are followed consistently
4. **Resource conflicts are prevented** through central management
5. **Advisory mode** is used for non-blocking background work
6. **Hub-and-spoke architecture** maintains proper boundaries
7. **Centralized logging system** works across all commands
8. **Session management** properly shares context between commands

**Result: ✅ Command architecture is production-ready with zero conflicts and intelligent coordination.**
